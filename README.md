This software provides the ability to link OpenWrt and AI. Based on user input, the AI provides the optimal settings for OpenWrt; the OpenWrt device itself analyzes the information provided by the AI, verifies the validity of that information, and then notifies the user.

## Chat with AI
[Main] ---> [Network] ---> [Oasis] ---> [Chat with AI]
<img width="943" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c11fb13-2c44-4d23-818c-27fd17da9693" />  
When chatting with AI for the first time, you can choose what topics to talk about. These options can be freely added or removed by the user in the System Message tab.
<img width="950" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f585550-03fa-48ca-9b8c-644d2221bce8" />  
When a chat with AI begins, it is given a title and displayed in the chat list on the left side.
"Users can continue chatting with AI, and if there is chat data from the past, they can select it to resume the conversation.

Chat data can be renamed, exported, or deleted.

## Ask OpenWrt Setting
Oasis is customizing the AI to specialize in OpenWrt. Therefore, it may prompt users to ask about OpenWrt. If a user requests configuration related to OpenWrt, the AI will suggest changes using UCI commands.  
<img width="944" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7ce13aff-b7f3-4594-80f7-a04d8a1bf012" />  
When a configuration change is suggested by the AI using UCI commands, the internal system of OpenWrt recognizes that a configuration change has been proposed by the AI. It then notifies the user via a popup to apply the configuration change to the current runtime. The user can accept the configuration change by pressing the Apply button.  
<img width="946" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1b7f41e-7b7a-4355-9438-4e621e9a2944" />
<img width="940" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6310c703-b2c3-49d5-b38a-ebab82c61896" />  
After applying the settings, if the user can access the WebUI, they will be notified in the Oasis chat screen to finalize the configuration change suggested by the AI. The user can press the Finalize button to approve the configuration change, or press the Rollback button to reject it.  
<img width="946" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/081313e4-e3ad-405f-a75b-ff4a46c83684" />
> [!IMPORTANT]
> After a configuration change, if the user does not press the Finalize or Rollback button within 5 minutes (default), the configuration will automatically rollback (Rollback monitoring). This ensures that even if there was a configuration error that caused a brick, the system will return to the original, normal settings. Note: If the OpenWrt device is powered off during the rollback monitoring period, the rollback monitoring will resume upon restart.

## System Message List
In Oasis, users can create and save system messages to use when starting a chat with AI. System messages are preloaded data used by AI to respond to the user.
For example, add a message like the following as a system message to instruct the AI to interpret English and Japanese.
<img width="947" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b3e41a7-d31c-47d7-9521-56c5a5a1e578" />  
Enter the instructions for the AI into the text area of 'Create System Message' and press the Add button to add it to the System Message List. This will register a new System Message called 'Translator.'
<img width="945" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f89b1b46-4bd4-432c-a5b0-fcb8d52ae8b7" />  
"When you return to the Chat with AI tab and start a new chat with the AI, 'Translator' will appear as a topic option.
